## Why Sensitive Skin Requires Special Shaving Solutions

Shaving can be a harsh experience for individuals with sensitive skin, leading to redness, rashes, and discomfort. Several factors contribute to irritation:

**•	Dull or Harsh Blades:** Traditional razors and low-quality electric shavers can cause excessive friction and cuts.

**•	Lack of Skin Protection Features:** Many standard shavers do not include hypoallergenic blades or cooling technology.
